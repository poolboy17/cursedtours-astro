          General James Oglethorpe founded Savannah in 1733 as the first city in the Georgia colony, laying it out in a distinctive grid of squares that remains intact today. What visitors admire as charming urban planning conceals a darker truth: Savannah was built directly over its dead, and the city never stopped burying bodies beneath its streets, squares, and buildings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yellow fever epidemics struck in 1820, 1854, and 1876. The 1820 outbreak killed 700 people—roughly 10% of the population—in a single summer. Bodies were buried wherever space could be found, including beneath the very squares where tourists now photograph Spanish moss. Colonial Park Cemetery, which closed in 1853, holds an estimated 10,000 bodies in a space designed for far fewer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city served as a major port in the transatlantic slave trade. Enslaved Africans arrived at the wharves on River Street, were sold at markets throughout downtown, and labored to build the mansions that line the historic squares. Their stories—and their graves—remain largely unmarked but deeply embedded in the city's haunted reputation.

      <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Why Savannah Is Haunted</h2>
      <div class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-4">
        <p>
          Savannah's grid of 22 historic squares—originally 24—each contain layers of human remains. When Oglethorpe designed the city, he couldn't have anticipated that his squares would become de facto cemeteries during epidemics and wars. Bodies were buried in mass graves, forgotten, and built over as the city expanded.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Revolutionary War saw Savannah under British occupation from 1778 to 1782. The Siege of Savannah in 1779 killed over 800 soldiers in a single failed assault, many buried where they fell. The Civil War brought Union occupation and a hospital system that converted hotels and homes into wards for the wounded and dying.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Great Fire of 1820 destroyed 463 buildings in the city center. Many victims were never recovered from the rubble. A second major fire in 1889 burned over 100 structures. Between fires, fevers, and warfare, Savannah accumulated the dead faster than it could properly bury them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colonial Park Cemetery accepted burials from 1750 to 1853. Originally outside city limits, it's now surrounded by downtown. Union soldiers reportedly moved headstones during occupation, making it impossible to know who lies where. Dueling victims, yellow fever dead, and executed criminals share the ground with Savannah's founding families.

        <p>
          Walking tours through the Historic District navigate between Savannah's most documented haunted locations. The Sorrel-Weed House on Harris Street, where both a wife and enslaved woman died under mysterious circumstances, offers tours of its carriage house where paranormal investigators have captured unexplained evidence.

              </div>

        <p>
          The Marshall House on Broughton Street served as a hospital during both the Civil War and yellow fever epidemics. Amputated limbs were reportedly thrown from upper windows into the alley below. Renovation crews in the 1990s discovered human remains beneath floorboards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most tours pass the Mercer-Williams House, made famous by "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil." Jim Williams shot Danny Hansford there in 1981, and guides recount the events alongside older tales of the home's spirits.

      <div class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
        <p>
          Colonial Park Cemetery, Savannah's oldest surviving burial ground, contains the remains of Button Gwinnett, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, alongside mass graves from yellow fever epidemics. The cemetery closed to new burials in 1853 but never stopped being disturbed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bonaventure Cemetery, three miles east of downtown, became famous through John Berendt's book and its haunting statuary. The Bird Girl sculpture has been moved to the Telfair Museum, but the cemetery's moss-draped oaks and Victorian monuments remain atmospheric. Tours operate during daylight hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Laurel Grove Cemetery, divided into North and South sections by race during segregation, contains Civil War dead from both armies. The South cemetery holds the remains of enslaved people and free Black citizens whose stories are only now being researched and told.

        <p>
          Savannah's open container laws allow to-go cups throughout the Historic District, making pub crawls a distinctive local tradition. The Pirate's House, operating since 1753 and mentioned in Robert Louis Stevenson's "Treasure Island," claims tunnels beneath it once led to the river for shanghaiing sailors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moon River Brewing Company occupies the former City Hotel, where construction workers and staff report aggressive paranormal activity. The building served as a hospital during yellow fever outbreaks, and its upper floors—closed to the public—have been featured on multiple ghost hunting television shows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Six Pence Pub, 17Hundred90, and The Olde Pink House each have their own documented ghost stories involving former residents, workers, or guests who never checked out. Tours typically visit 3-4 locations over two hours.

        <p>
          For those who prefer not to walk Savannah's uneven sidewalks, trolley ghost tours cover more ground while providing air-conditioned or heated comfort. Tours typically last 90 minutes and pass locations that walking tours can't easily reach.

          Several Savannah locations offer hands-on paranormal investigation experiences. The Sorrel-Weed House provides equipment including EMF detectors, spirit boxes, and infrared cameras for small-group investigations of its carriage house and main residence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moon River Brewing Company's upper floors, typically closed to the public, open for occasional investigation events. The building's reputation for aggressive activity makes these experiences intense—and popular with serious investigators.
