          Between February 1692 and May 1693, colonial Massachusetts executed twenty people for witchcraft. The Salem witch trials began when two young girls in Salem Village—now Danvers—experienced fits that a local doctor attributed to supernatural causes. Within months, accusations spread through Essex County, filling jails with accused witches and creating a panic that has defined Salem's identity ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trials ended when Governor William Phips dissolved the special court after his own wife was accused. By then, over 200 people had been accused, twenty executed, and several more died in prison. The Massachusetts General Court later declared the trials unlawful, and in 1711, the colonial legislature restored the good names of the accused and provided financial restitution to their families.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern Salem embraces this dark history while struggling to separate documented facts from centuries of embellishment. Ghost tours navigate between verified trial sites, later legends, and the commercial Halloween industry that dominates the city each October.

      <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Why Salem Is Haunted</h2>
      <div class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-4">
        <p>
          The witch trials created victims whose deaths were acknowledged as wrongful within a generation of their execution. This official recognition—rare in cases of historical injustice—may contribute to Salem's haunted reputation. The executed weren't criminals; they were innocent people killed by their neighbors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gallows Hill, the execution site, went unmarked for centuries. Recent research identified Proctor's Ledge as the likely location, now a memorial. The bodies of the executed were denied proper burial, thrown into crevices near the gallows. Some families reportedly retrieved remains under cover of darkness, but most victims have no known graves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The accusers lived among the families of their victims for decades after the trials. Samuel Sewall, one of the judges, publicly apologized in 1697. Ann Putnam Jr., who accused 62 people including her former neighbors, apologized in 1706. This prolonged coexistence of accusers, survivors, and descendants created a community literally haunted by guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the trials, Salem's maritime history added its own ghosts. As a major port, the city saw its share of shipwrecks, drownings, and sailors who never returned. The Custom House where Nathaniel Hawthorne worked, the House of the Seven Gables that inspired his novel, and the wharves along Derby Street all carry their own documented histories.

          The Witch House, home of Judge Jonathan Corwin, is the only structure still standing with direct ties to the trials. Corwin conducted preliminary examinations of accused witches here before they faced the Court of Oyer and Terminer. The house has been restored to its 1692 appearance and offers guided tours explaining trial procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Salem Witch Trials Memorial, dedicated in 1992 on the 300th anniversary, lists all twenty executed victims on granite benches. The memorial's design—incomplete sentences carved into stone thresholds—represents how the accused were cut off mid-defense by their accusers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Peabody Essex Museum holds original trial documents including examinations, depositions, and death warrants. These primary sources offer unfiltered access to the voices of accusers, accused, and judges.

          The Charter Street Cemetery, also called the Old Burying Point, dates to 1637 and contains graves of Mayflower passengers and witch trial judge John Hathorne—ancestor of novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, who added the 'w' to distance himself from his family's role in the trials.
        </p>
        <p>
          None of the executed witches are buried in Salem's colonial cemeteries. Their bodies were denied consecrated ground and disposed of near the gallows. The Charter Street Cemetery does contain graves of accused witches who died in prison before trial, including Sarah Osborne.
        </p>
        <p>
          Howard Street Cemetery holds the grave of Giles Corey, pressed to death when he refused to enter a plea. According to legend, his final words were "more weight." The cemetery, smaller and less visited than Charter Street, has a more intimate atmosphere.

          Evening walking tours combine witch trial history with later ghost stories accumulated over 400 years of Salem history. Tours typically last 90 minutes and cover about a mile of downtown Salem, visiting the Witch House, Charter Street Cemetery, the Witch Trials Memorial, and various haunted taverns and homes.
        </p>
        <p>
          History-focused tours separate documented trial facts from legends that developed later. The best guides acknowledge when stories entered the record and distinguish between primary sources and folklore.
        </p>
        <p>
          October tours book weeks in advance and operate with larger groups. For a more intimate experience, visit during shoulder seasons when guides have time for questions and smaller groups allow access to sites that can't accommodate crowds.

          The Peabody Essex Museum, one of the oldest continuously operating museums in America, holds an exceptional collection of witch trial documents and Salem maritime history. The museum's East India Marine Hall and period rooms provide context for colonial Salem beyond the trials.
        </p>
        <p>
          The House of the Seven Gables, built in 1668 and inspiration for Hawthorne's novel, offers tours focusing on the Turner family history and Hawthorne's connection to the property. The house predates the witch trials by 24 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Salem Witch Museum presents a dramatic retelling of the trials using stage sets and life-size figures. While not historically rigorous, it provides a visceral introduction to the events for visitors new to the story.

        </p>
        <p>
          Some tour operators offer paranormal investigation experiences with EMF detectors, spirit boxes, and other equipment. The Joshua Ward House, built on the site of Sheriff George Corwin's home, allows investigation by appointment.
