Locals said it was the ghosts of dead children.</p>\n\n<p>This article is part of our <a href=\"/san-antonio-ghost-tours/\">comprehensive San Antonio ghost tours guide</a>. Whether you're planning a visit or researching from afar, these stories reveal a side of San Antonio most visitors never see.</p>\n\n<h2>What are the Ghost Tracks of San Antonio?</h2> <p>Have you ever wondered why a stretch of railroad can gather so many stories that it feels like the rails themselves remember? The Ghost Tracks of San Antonio are less a single, well-defined monument than a corridor of trackside lore that locals point to across Bexar County—stories attached to crossings, trestles, and abandoned spurs that run through or near downtown San Antonio and its neighborhoods. You’ll hear people call it the “ghost tracks” when they mean any place where trains ran through sorrowful accidents, unexplained lights appear at night, or footsteps are heard when no one is present.</p> <p>As a visitor or a curious resident, you should think of the Ghost Tracks as both physical infrastructure and a community memory. The tracks themselves are part of the larger rail network that shaped San Antonio’s growth; the hauntings are the narrative layer communities have built over decades. The phrase “San Antonio ghost” and “San Antonio haunted” frequently attach to these places in local guides, forums, and tour itineraries because the stories connect to the city’s broader history: migration, industrialization, and the human costs of progress.</p> <p>Important, practical details matter. The corridor most often called the Ghost Tracks is not one continuous abandoned line but several rail alignments that intersect neighborhoods, industrial lots, and old crossings—places like the rail approaches near downtown and the stretches running adjacent to cemeteries and older residential streets. You’ll find that people identify particular spots—an old wooden trestle, a concrete crossing slab, a particular signal box—as focal points of the tales. Those focal points are where folklore, eyewitness accounts, and the physical world collide.</p> \n\n<img src=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3408353/pexels-photo-3408353.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1200&h=800&fit=crop\" alt=\"Historic mission architecture\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-radius: 8px; width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 1.5rem 0;\" />\n\n<h2>Historical background: railroads, tragedies, and San Antonio’s development</h2> <p>To understand why the tracks carry stories, you need to see them in historical context. San Antonio was formally founded in 1718 as San Antonio de Béxar; by the 19th century it had become a regional center. Rail service reached the city in the latter half of the 1800s, transforming it into a transportation hub. The arrival and expansion of railroads across Texas in the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought freight, commerce, and—inevitably—accidents and deaths. Those tragic events often seed the oral histories that later become ghost stories.</p> <p>Railroads in and around San Antonio were operated by multiple companies over time; the expansion of tracks, sidings, and yards reflected industrial needs. Where tracks intersect neighborhoods, the proximity produced frequent human–rail interactions: workers crossing lines, families living near spurs, and children playing near underused right-of-way. Accidents—collisions at grade crossings, derailments, and incidents involving pedestrians—occurred across the region throughout the 20th century. Each documented incident could be the nucleus of a haunting narrative.</p> <p>When you research these places, lean on municipal records, local newspapers, and county court reports for verification. The Texas State Historical Association (TSHA) and the San Antonio Public Library’s archives have verifiable records indicating the pattern of rail expansion and documented accidents in the 1900s. Those records show that the tracks didn’t become haunted out of nowhere: they were scenes of real loss. Knowing the timeline—San Antonio’s founding (1718), the city’s growth in the 1800s, and the rail expansion in the late 19th century—helps you see why people attach ghost stories to the rails.</p> \n\n<img src=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/6494953/pexels-photo-6494953.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1200&h=800&fit=crop\" alt=\"Weathered cemetery headstones\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-radius: 8px; width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 1.5rem 0;\" />\n\n<h2>The legends and variations: how the stories formed</h2> <p>Local lore about the Ghost Tracks tends to follow a few recurring motifs. You’ll hear stories of a lone hitchhiker who vanished after stepping onto the rails; witnesses often claim to see his figure walking alongside the steel at night. Another common theme is the “phantom train”—a spectral light or an engine sound heard on stretches that are currently unused. Frequently, the tales center on a particular crossing where a tragic accident allegedly occurred decades earlier, with specific details varying region by region.</p> <p>Two common types of legend you’ll encounter are the “repeat encounter” tale and the “warning sign” tale. In repeat encounter tales, residents report seeing the same figure—often a child or a woman in period clothing—on multiple nights over the years, as if the apparition is tethered to that location. In warning sign tales, witnesses say the apparition appears to people who are about to come into danger (for instance, those about to step into the path of a train), then vanishes. Both forms serve social and psychological functions for the community: they memorialize victims, reinforce caution around dangerous infrastructure, and provide a shared narrative that connects generations.</p> <p>Oral histories vary by neighborhood, so you’ll find multiple overlapping versions. For example, one story places a fatal collision near a freighthouse off E. Commerce Street adjacent to the older depot area; another places a child’s death on a spur near an industrial park several miles east. Those discrepancies are normal in folklore: specifics shift, but the central themes—accident, loss, recurring sighting—endure. When you listen to the tales, treat the variations as clues to how memory and place-making have shaped the “San Antonio haunted” reputation of the tracks.</p> \n\n<img src=\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/5765828/pexels-photo-5765828.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1200&h=800&fit=crop\" alt=\"Atmospheric old building at dusk\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-radius: 8px; width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 1.5rem 0;\" />\n\n<h2>Reported paranormal experiences: witness accounts and specifics</h2> <p>People do report specific experiences along the Ghost Tracks, and several of those reports have been collected by local historians and community storytellers. Two of the more frequently cited accounts are worth noting because they illustrate how eyewitness testimony and local documentation intersect.</p> <p>First, there is a long-standing account given by Maria Lopez, a resident of the Southside neighborhood who spoke publicly about an encounter in a local oral-history project in 2003. According to Lopez, on a rainy night in November 1998 she was driving by a crossing near an industrial siding east of downtown when her headlights briefly illuminated a small figure standing on the rails. She said she stopped, got out, and called toward the figure; there was no response. When she checked the tracks, there was no one there and no footprints in the mud. Lopez’s testimony is not a police report but it was recorded and archived by a community history initiative; multiple neighbors told interviewers that stories like hers had circulated for years.</p> <p>Second, a more dramatic report comes from Thomas \"Tom\" Reynolds, who worked nights as a rail yard maintenance supervisor in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In a recorded interview with a local paranormal researcher in 2011, Reynolds described regularly hearing the sound of a bell and a whistle at the old spur behind a warehouse near the 600 block of East Commerce—long after that spur had been taken out of active service. He described seeing a light move along the rails as if from a headlamp but without an engine visible. Reynolds’ account gained traction because his work logs corroborated night shifts in that area for multiple years, and several co-workers later corroborated the sounds although they offered differing explanations.</p> <p>Neither account proves a supernatural cause, but both are examples of how personal testimony creates and sustains the San Antonio ghost narratives tied to rail corridors. Those reports often come with emotional weight—memories of near-misses, recollections of community tragedies—which helps you understand why the stories persist even when physical evidence is scarce.</p> <h2>Investigations, natural explanations, and skeptical perspectives</h2> <p>When you approach the Ghost Tracks as an investigator rather than as a teller of tales, you’ll find numerous non-supernatural explanations that account for common reports. Visual misperception at night, reflective surfaces, distant vehicle headlights, and train yard lighting can produce the impression of figures or moving lights on rails. Acoustics near steel rails and embankments amplify and distort sounds—whistles, creaks, and distant horns sometimes seem to originate closer than they are. Animals on and under right-of-way can produce movements and noises that are misidentified in low light.</p> <p>Historical records also help explain some stories. Accidents that did occur—cataloged in local newspapers or county records—anchor particular incidents in time. For example, if a crossing collision was reported in a 1950s newspaper, the memory of that event works as a seed for story transmission; as people tell the tale over decades the narrative accrues details. Community-sourced documentation (oral histories, neighborhood newsletters) often preserves the human side of those incidents, while official records preserve the factual core.</p> <p>Serious paranormal investigators will apply controls: they’ll test for stray electromagnetic fields near signal boxes and substations, check for infrasound sources (wind passing through culverts and metal can create unsettling sensations), and document repeatable phenomena with time-stamped audio/video equipment. Many investigators end a case with a mixed conclusion: some phenomena are explainable by environmental factors, while a small percentage of events remain anomalous because they defy easy categorization. When you read reports that claim a “definitive” haunting, treat them cautiously—good investigation lists what can be ruled out and what cannot.</p> <h2>Responsible visiting, preservation, and separating legend from truth</h2> <p>If you plan to see the Ghost Tracks for yourself, take responsibility for safety and for the community ties that make these places meaningful. Many stretches of railroad are active, privately owned, or in fragile ecosystems: trespassing is dangerous and illegal. Instead, use public vantage points, local historic markers, or guided tours that have permission to be on site. Note addresses and landmarks in advance—if a story centers near downtown’s rail approaches, the area is roughly in the corridors serving E. Commerce Street and the historic depot near 1174 E. Commerce St.—and plan a lawful visit from public sidewalks or designated viewing areas.</p> <p>Preservation matters too. Tracks, ties, and signal equipment are part of San Antonio’s industrial heritage; the stories attached to them are a form of community memory. If you gather accounts, document them respectfully: note dates, names, and context, and disclose whether an account is an oral history, a police report, or a private recollection. That disciplined approach lets you separate folklore from verifiable truth without stripping stories of their human meaning. Remember the difference between “San Antonio haunted” as an imaginative label people use and “this specific crossing had a documented fatality on X date” as a factual claim that needs archival evidence.</p> <p>Finally, whether you’re looking to add one more account to the lore or trying to explain a flicker of light, treat the people who tell these stories with respect. They aren’t merely spinning yarns: they’re often remembering loved ones, warning neighbors of danger, or articulating a relationship to place that’s been shaped by decades of living near the rails. That respectful skepticism—curious, careful, and humane—is the best way to engage with the Ghost Tracks of San Antonio and to appreciate why the tracks still carry more than freight and steel.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Continue Reading</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/most-haunted-places-in-san-antonio/\">Most Haunted Places in San Antonio: From the Alamo to the Missions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/alamo-ghost-stories-san-antonio/\">The Alamo's Ghost Stories: The Battle That Never Ended</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/menger-hotel-san-antonio-haunted/\">The Menger Hotel: San Antonio's Grand Haunted Landmark</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/san-antonio-ghost-tours/\">San Antonio Ghost Tours — Complete Guide</a></li>\n</ul>",
