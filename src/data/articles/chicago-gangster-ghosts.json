  "content": "Between 1920 and 1933, Prohibition transformed Chicago into a war zone. Over 700 gangland murders occurred in the city during this period, most of them never solved. The violence was driven by the economics of illegal alcohol: an industry worth an estimated $100 million annually controlled by competing criminal organizations willing to kill for market share.\n\nThe era produced some of America's most infamous criminals—Al Capone, Bugs Moran, Dean O'Banion, and John Dillinger among them. It also produced ghosts. The sites of Prohibition-era violence remain <a href=\"/articles/most-haunted-places-in-chicago/\">among Chicago's most actively haunted locations</a>, generating reports that have persisted for nearly a century after the gunfire stopped.\n\n\n<figure class=\"my-8\"><img src=\"/images/articles/inline/chicago-gangster-ghosts-3.jpg\" alt=\"Chicago Gangster Ghosts: Capone & Dillinger\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full\" /></figure>\n<h2>The St. Valentine's Day Massacre</h2>\nOn February 14, 1929, seven men associated with George \"Bugs\" Moran's North Side Gang were lined against a wall inside a garage at 2122 North Clark Street and shot by gunmen dressed as police officers. The massacre was widely attributed to Al Capone's organization, though Capone was in Florida at the time and no one was ever convicted of the killings.\n\nThe victims—Pete Gusenberg, Frank Gusenberg, Albert Kachellek (alias James Clark), Adam Heyer, Reinhart Schwimmer, Albert Weinshank, and John May—were killed with Thompson submachine guns and shotguns. Frank Gusenberg survived the initial shooting and was found alive by real police officers. When asked who shot him, he reportedly replied: \"Nobody shot me.\" He died three hours later at a hospital.\n\nThe garage was demolished in 1967, but not before the bullet-scarred wall was purchased by a Canadian businessman. The bricks were sold individually to collectors and have been associated with reports of bad luck and supernatural phenomena by several owners. The site at 2122 North Clark Street is now a parking lot adjacent to a nursing home. Visitors and employees have reported hearing gunfire and screaming from the empty lot, particularly on or around February 14.\n\n\n<figure class=\"my-8\"><img src=\"/images/articles/inline/chicago-gangster-ghosts-1.jpg\" alt=\"The St. Valentine's Day Massacre\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full\" /></figure>\n<h2>The Biograph Theater</h2>\n\nJohn Dillinger was not a Prohibition gangster in the traditional sense—he robbed banks, not bootlegging operations—but his death in Chicago cemented the city's reputation for spectacular criminal violence. On July 22, 1934, FBI agents shot Dillinger outside the Biograph Theater on Lincoln Avenue after he emerged from a showing of the film Manhattan Melodrama.\n\nThe woman who identified Dillinger to the waiting agents, Ana Cumpănaș (a Romanian-born madam), was described in press reports as wearing a red dress. She was actually wearing an orange skirt—the red appearance was the result of the theater's marquee lights. Nevertheless, she entered legend as \"the Lady in Red.\"\n\nDillinger fell in the alley adjacent to the theater. Bystanders reportedly dipped handkerchiefs and newspaper in his blood as souvenirs. The theater continues to operate as a venue, its original marquee still intact. Pedestrians have reported seeing a blue, translucent figure running into the alley and vanishing. The alley itself produces a persistent, localized chill that visitors describe as inconsistent with surrounding temperatures.\n\n<h2>Al Capone's Chicago</h2>\nAlphonse Gabriel Capone controlled Chicago's bootlegging, gambling, and prostitution operations from the mid-1920s until his conviction for tax evasion in 1931. His operations generated an estimated $100 million annually—equivalent to over $1.5 billion today. He maintained headquarters at the Lexington Hotel at 22nd Street and Michigan Avenue, where he occupied several floors and conducted business behind layers of armed guards.\n\nThe Lexington Hotel was demolished in 1995, but during its final decades, employees and visitors reported phenomena consistent with a haunted location: unexplained sounds, cold spots, the sensation of being watched, and—most distinctively—the smell of cigar smoke in rooms where no one was smoking. Capone was famously attached to his cigars, and the olfactory element of these reports lends them a specificity unusual in haunted location claims.\n\nOther Capone-associated locations include the Congress Plaza Hotel on Michigan Avenue, where he maintained a suite, and the Green Mill Cocktail Lounge in Uptown, where he held a reserved booth near the back exit (positioned for quick escape). The Green Mill still operates as a jazz club and retains its original 1920s interior, including the tunnels beneath the building used for bootlegging. The bar has embraced its gangster heritage, and staff report occasional unexplained occurrences—glasses moving, cold drafts from the tunnel entrances, and the sound of jazz music from the basement when no one is below.\n\n\n<figure class=\"my-8\"><img src=\"/images/articles/inline/chicago-gangster-ghosts-2.jpg\" alt=\"Al Capone's Chicago\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full\" /></figure>\n<h2>Dean O'Banion's Flower Shop</h2>\n\nBefore Capone consolidated power, Chicago's bootlegging was controlled by several competing organizations. Dean O'Banion, leader of the North Side Gang, operated a flower shop at 738 North State Street—directly across from Holy Name Cathedral. The shop served as both a legitimate business (O'Banion was a skilled florist) and a front for his bootlegging operations.\n\nOn November 10, 1924, three men entered O'Banion's shop, ostensibly to pick up a flower arrangement. One man shook O'Banion's hand and held it while the other two shot him six times. The murder, ordered by Johnny Torrio and carried out by Frankie Yale, launched the gang war that would culminate in the Valentine's Day Massacre five years later.\n\nThe flower shop location has housed various businesses since, and Holy Name Cathedral across the street still bears bullet scars from a related shooting—the 1926 assassination of O'Banion's successor, Hymie Weiss, on the cathedral steps. Visitors to the area report a persistent sense of unease, and some have described seeing a figure arranging flowers in the window of the building that was once O'Banion's shop.\n\n<h2>The Geography of Violence</h2>\n\nWhat distinguishes Chicago's gangster ghosts from its other hauntings is the personal nature of the violence. The <a href=\"/articles/great-chicago-fire-ghosts/\">Great Fire</a> and the <a href=\"/articles/eastland-disaster-chicago/\">Eastland Disaster</a> were impersonal catastrophes. The gangster killings were targeted murders—individuals killed by name, for specific reasons, in specific places.\n\n<a href=\"/chicago-ghost-tours/\">Ghost tours</a> that focus on Chicago's gangster era navigate a landscape where the violence was intimate and the locations are precisely known. The garage where seven men were executed. The alley where Dillinger fell. The flower shop where O'Banion was gunned down over a handshake. These are not abstract historical events but crimes committed at identifiable street addresses, by identifiable perpetrators, against identifiable victims.\n\nThe ghosts, if they exist, are equally specific. They are not anonymous specters but individuals—a running figure in a familiar alley, cigar smoke in an empty room, the sound of gunfire on a February night from a lot where a garage once stood.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Continue Reading</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/most-haunted-places-in-chicago/\">Chicago's Most Haunted Places</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/hh-holmes-murder-castle-chicago/\">H.H.
